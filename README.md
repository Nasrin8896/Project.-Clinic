Initial commit - Clinic Project

This is the first version of the "Clinic" web project, including the
main HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The goal of this version is to
set up a simple and responsive website to introduce clinic services,
provide contact information, an "About Us" section, and an appointment
request form.

File structure:
- index.html → main page
- style.css → project styles
- script.js → basic front-end logic

This version lays the foundation of the project and will be improved
with more features and design enhancements in the future.
